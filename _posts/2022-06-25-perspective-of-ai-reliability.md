## A Statistical Perspective 

In this post we would like to discuss the reliability of AI algorithms.


## Data Thinking Perspective

 Statistical Perspectives on Reliability of Artificial Intelligence Systems
 
## Computational Thinking Perspective

There are several aspects of computation playing roles in the robustness of algorithm. 

- Could Computing

- Fog Computing

- The computational infrastructure also matters. 

## Summary

In this post, we investigate the robustness of the AI classification algorithms.
