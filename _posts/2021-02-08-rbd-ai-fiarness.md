# Introduction

The key concept in robust parameter design is to better the predictor varaible via the control varaible, noise variables, and the control-by-noise interaction.  

# Robust Parameter Design

By exploring the control-by-noise interaction, it provide the possiblilty of adjusting the setting of control variables to make the variation of response ($y$) less senstitive to the noise factors.  


# AI Fairness

While in the AI algorithm, the key is to make the preditive model to be less affected (i.e., being fair) by some demographic variables.
