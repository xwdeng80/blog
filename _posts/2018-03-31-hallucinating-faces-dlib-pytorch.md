In this post we would like to discuss the robustness of AI algorithms.

 1. The effect of the label proportions of labels in the training data.
 2. The effect of the distribution changes between the training data and test data.

# An Experimental Design Perspective

```
The first part here was saving the face detector model in an XML format, using `net_to_xml`, like in this [dlib example](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/examples/dnn_introduction_ex.cpp#L164).
```

# Data Thinking Perspective

***The purpose of this section is emphsize the data quality needs to be assured for AI algorithm. ***

To get an data of good quality,

# Computational Thinking Perspective

There are several aspects of computation playing roles in the robustness of algorithm. 

- Could Computing

- Fog Computing

- The computational infrastrature. 

# Summary
