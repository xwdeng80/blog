## What is Experimentation in Data Science.

Experiments in Data Science require proper planning and design to best answer its problem of interest.

## How to Make Principled Experimentation

 -- A clear objective of study

 -- A well planned experiments of collecting data
 
 -- A proper model to analysis the data and make inference: How does the model work? When the model give good performance? Why the proposed method can perform well or worse. 

## Summary
