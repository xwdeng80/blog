## What are Point Clouds.

A point cloud is a set of data points in space, usually in two or three dimensional space.
In three-dimensional space, these points represent the X, Y, and Z geometric coordinates of a single point on an underlying surface.

Two commonly-used methods of creating point clouds data are "Photogrammetry" and "Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)".

## The Importance of using Point Cloud

Point cloud data often can help users to understand the surrounding reality. Quantifying the dissimilarity between two unstructured 3D point clouds is a challenging task.
