# Introduction

Online Experimentation has been very pouplar with wide applications in various sectors. However, there is a gap between research and application needs on the design and analysis of online experiments. In this post, we would like to provide a better picture of the online experiments. 

# Perspectives

The conventional A/B testing conisdier the treatment and control (design A or design B) are randomly assign to experiment units (users). 
For example, a e-commerce company consider two promotion webpages to boost the click rates. 
In online experimentation, it is common for millions of users to arrive at the top homepage webpage, while only a small percentage of users reach the
bottom purchase webpage). Between the transition from the top page to the bottom page, users need to navigate through multiple pages where they can exit from the
shopping process.

There are also other online experiments such as switchback experiment and sequanetial experiments.
